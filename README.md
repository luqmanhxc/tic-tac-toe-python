# About 

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made in Python to practice functions.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ipython

```bash
pip install ipython
```

## What I learnt
- How functions make my code more readable and reusable.
- How functions work with each other.
- Creating a game board using a list and it's indexes.
- Using boolean for toggling states.
